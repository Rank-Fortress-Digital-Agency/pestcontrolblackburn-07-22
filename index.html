                    Pests can cause serious damage to your home and property
                </h2>
                <div class="two-col">
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            No one wants pests in their home. They can cause serious damage to your property and even put your family’s health at risk. But what can you do about them? There are a number of steps you can take to reduce the chances of pests invading your home, and if they do show up, there are ways to get rid of them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One important step is to make sure that your home is as clean as possible. Keep all surfaces clear of clutter and make sure that there are no food sources for the pests. Sweep and mop regularly, and vacuum often – especially around baseboards and furniture. Make sure that all trash cans are tightly sealed, and take out the garbage on a regular basis. If you have a pet, be sure to keep its food bowl clean, too.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                </div>
                <p>
                    Another key step is to seal any cracks or openings in your home’s exterior. Caulk any gaps around windows and doors, and install weather stripping around door frames. Repair any holes in the roof or siding, and make sure that there is no water leakage anywhere around your house. The less accessible your home is for pests, the less likely they are to invade it.

Pests such as cockroaches, rats, and mice can all carry dangerous diseases that can affect humans. These diseases include salmonella, E. coli, and Hantavirus, among others. In addition, pests can also bring in other types of germs and bacteria that can cause illness.

                    Insects often lay eggs in food supplies or bedding materials. When the eggs hatch, the larvae can quickly eat through fabrics, wood, plasterboard, and other materials. They can also contaminate food with their excrement or saliva. Rodents often gnaw on wires and cables, which can lead to electrical fires. They also contaminate food with their urine and feces.
